## Run codegen

go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate

## Create table
psql -U postgres

```sql
CREATE TABLE leaderboard (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  rank INTEGER NOT NULL,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

## Create docker build without cache

docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose build --no-cache client_application


## Build just one microservice
docker compose up -d --build --no-deps client_application

## Run docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

## Run a specific container
docker ps
docker exec -it 8b34ff8edc4e bash

##

Run mutation and queries

```js
mutation createDummyUser($user_name: String!, $score: Int!) {
  createUser(user_name: $user_name, score: $score) {
    user_id
    user_name
    rank
    score
  }
}

{
  "user_name": "Dummy User",
  "score": 0
}

query {
	leaderboard {
    score
    user_id
    user_name
  }
}
```

## Game service
http://localhost:4000/
```js
query GetLeaderboard {
  leaderboard {
    score
    user_id
    user_name
  }
}
```

How it works:

Zookeeper: Manages Kafka broker metadata, leader election, and coordination. Itâ€™s required for Kafka to operate.
Kafka Broker: Handles event storage and delivery. It receives events from producers (e.g., game_service) and delivers them to consumers (e.g., leaderboard_service).
Kafka Topic: A named stream (e.g., leaderboard-events) where events are published. Producers write to topics, consumers read from them.
Kafka (Event Bus): Represents the overall event streaming system, connecting producers and consumers via topics.
